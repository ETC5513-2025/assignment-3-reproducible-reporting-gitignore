## Title Slide  
**From Data to Action: Leveraging Bike-Sharing Patterns to Enhance Sustainable Mobility**  
ETC5513 – Assignment 3 Presentation  
**Team Members:**

## Introduction *(Thuy)*

- Why bike sharing is relevant for modern cities  
- Growing demand for sustainable transport  
- Australia’s urban cycling culture (especially students)  
- Report aim: analyze rental patterns to uncover demand drivers

---

## Dataset Overview *(Thuy)*

- **Source**: UCI ML Repository [@fanaee2014event]  
- **Data range**: 2011–2012  
- **Files**: `day.csv` (daily), `hour.csv` (hourly)  
- **Variables**: temp, humidity, windspeed, seasons, user type, etc.  

---

## Methodology *(Izzul)*

- Tools used: `R`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `Quarto`, `Git`  
- Data grouped by weather, time, and user type  
- Branches for sections; merged into reproducible report  
- Collaborative version control with conflict resolution

---

## Weather vs Rentals *(Izzul)*

- Temp and “feels like” temp positively influence rentals  
- Humidity and windspeed show weaker negative impact  
- *Include scatter or facet chart (optional)*

---

## Hourly Rental Patterns *(Thuy)*

- Peaks at 8 AM and 5–6 PM = commute hours  
- Weekdays show consistent patterns; weekends more variable  
- *Optional: plot of hour vs. average count by weektype*

---

## Seasonal Trends & User Types *(Bhuvana)*

- Rentals highest in summer & fall  
- Registered users dominate in winter  
- Casual users rise sharply in warmer seasons  
- *Optional bar plot or table*

---

## Key Findings *(Bhuvana)*

| Factor         | Insight                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Temperature    | Strong positive impact               |
| Time of day    | Commuting hours = peak usage         |
| Season         | Summer & fall = highest demand       |
| User type      | Registered = consistent; casual = seasonal |

---

## Recommendations *(Bhuvana)*

- Add more docking stations in summer tourist areas  
- Prioritize maintenance for weekday commuter hubs  
- Use rental data to guide staff rebalancing & marketing  
- Apply this model in Australian cities or universities
